The iconic General Post Office in Dublin was designed by Francis Johnston in the Greek Revival Style in 1814. The main section of the building was made with Wicklow granite and the portico of Portland stone. Inside you will find a stunning bronze statue of The Death of CÃºchulainn by Oliver Sheppard, placed there in 1935. Today the statue is one of the Talking Statues that tells a story via your phone.
The GPO was important as the main stronghold of the Irish Volunteers in the 1916 Rising. The Witness History Museum is an excellent way to learn about the Rising. You can still see round bullet holes in the large columns outside. Since the building was destroyed except for the front portico and facade, it was rebuilt and reopened in 1929. It retained elements of the original design while introducing some attractive art deco features. The GPO is often a place of remembrance, protests and pageantry.
